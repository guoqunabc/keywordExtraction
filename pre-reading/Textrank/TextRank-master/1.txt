In this paper, polar coding is combined with the generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) and the channel polarization idea is extended to the GFDM system, which is a flexible multicarrier modulation scheme proposed for future waveform. First, the framework of polar coded GFDM (PC-GFDM) is constructed based on a two-stage channel polarization transform. In the first stage, on the basis of bit-interleaved code modulation, GFDM channel is divided into a set of parallel binary-input GFDM synthesized channels. In the second stage, by using the binary channel polarization, the GFDM synthesized channels are further polarized into a set of bit polarized channels. The polar codes are efficiently constructed by calculating the reliabilities of the two-stage polarized channels. Then, an empirically optimal interleaver is designed for PC-GFDM. Furthermore, regarding the features of GFDM synthesized channels, a simplified block interleaving scheme is proposed to approach the optimal interleaver and reduce the implementation complexity. Compared with the conventional turbo coded GFDM (TC-GFDM), simulation results indicate that our proposed PC-GFDM system can outperform the TC-GFDM system by at least 1dB for different scenarios.
